Funktions
Len() = integer value of the number of characters in a string
str() function can be passed an integer value and will evaluate to a string value version of it
int (1.99) would be express to 1
elif else if : It provides another condition that is checked only if all of the previous conditions were F

Types
List
eggs = ['hello', 42, 0.5]
Tuple: 
eggs = ('hello', 42, 0.5)
But the main way that tuples are different from lists is that tuples, like strings, are immutable. Tuples cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.
Hint for tuple with only one entry:
>>> type(('hello',))
<class 'tuple'>
>>> type(('hello'))
<class 'str'>
